# A-confectionery-Design-Pattern-Project-
The project helps a confectioner generate a bill. After the customer decides upon the choice of flavors he wishes to order. The program uses the Decorator Pattern to calculate the bill. Now the confectioner realizes that the combination he served were not working out and instead changes the menu so that the customer decides to serve only a single flavored ice â€“ cream and that too following a very rigid procedure. The design also incorporates the use of the Singleton Pattern in baking the pastry using singleton class microwave oven.
